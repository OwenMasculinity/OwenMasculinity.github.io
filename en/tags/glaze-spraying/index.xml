      <description>Glaze spraying is a key process in ceramic production, yet how to make the glaze coating uniform in various situations is a rather confusing issue. We have to set up different models at different times. If we can find a relatively universal strategy, much time can be saved.
In this paper, we adopt elliptic double Î² distribution model to obtain the thickness cumulative model on planes and solve Issue 1. Then we modify the basic model to make it applicable when dealing with curved surfaces and spheres.</description>
