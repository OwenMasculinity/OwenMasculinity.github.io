The sequential recommender system takes successive user-item interactions and dynamic users’ preferences into account, which brings powerful hidden representations of users. Conventional methods of such patterns mainly include Markov Chains (MCs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Recently, the use of self-attention mechanisms and bidirectional architectures enables recommendations not only to capture long-term semantics but also to fuse information from both the left and right sides. However, a major limitation can be observed in previous strategies—unstable representations of users. Sequential models only mine the relationship between items that users have interacted rather than forming the whole representation of each user, which is often a constraint on the further improvement of recommendation performance. To address this limitation, we propose a mixed sequential recommendation by combining bidirectional self-attention with direct user-item match, which brings two benefits. For one thing, our model can learn bidirectional semantics from users’ behavioral sequences. For another, it produces more stable users’ representations and achieves better recommendation performance. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate our approach considerably outperforms various state-of-the-art sequential models.","tags":["recommendation system","deep learning","matching"],"title":"Bidirectional Encoder Representation with Matching Task for Sequential Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The demo of the face attack system based on the adversarial sample (black box attack) is completed, which makes the AWS Face Rekognition system incorrectly classify.\n","date":1560268800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560268800,"objectID":"b2f06281f537c445e5c422137056afec","permalink":"https://OwenMasculinity.github.io/en/project/adversarial-sample/","publishdate":"2019-06-12T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/project/adversarial-sample/","section":"project","summary":"Adversarial attack against face recognition","tags":["adversarial sample","computer vision","face recognition"],"title":"Face adversarial sample","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"ZiYue is the name of a gold jewelry series that means appaintment between parents and children.\n","date":1558800000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558800000,"objectID":"d848ecd6f14fc172f95a7fe008630233","permalink":"https://OwenMasculinity.github.io/en/project/ziyue/","publishdate":"2019-05-26T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/project/ziyue/","section":"project","summary":"ZiYue: gold jewelry series","tags":["gold jewelry design"],"title":"ZiYue","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project is a social innovation project that belongs to the intersection of urban science.

Remote sensing images can objectively and truly record and reflect the intensity of electromagnetic radiation of surface objects, which are significant manifestations for information obtained by remote sensing detection. And remote sensing image classification plays an significant role in remote sensing image processing. This paper is carried out on the basis of deep learning methods for remote sensing image classification. The specific research content can be divided into the following three parts: (1) For aerial scene classification, this paper introduces the classification methods based various deep neural networks, and compares the advantages and disadvantages of various networks on UMCL dataset. The experimental results illustrate that the classification accuracy based on GoogleNet is the highest. In order to improve the accuracy, we also use Fine-Tuning to test on UMCL dataset. (2) For hyperspectral remote sensing image classification, this paper introduces joint spectral-spatial classification and validates the feasibility of the method on Pavia dataset and Indian Pines dataset. The experimental results show that the method retains the shape and detail of some objects, while simultaneously eliminating noisy scattered points of misclassification. (3) For large-scale and high-spatial resolution remote sensing image classification, this paper introduces two classification methods: Scene Classification based on Image Tiles and Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis(GEOBIA) based on Multiresolution Segmentation algorithm. By testing on a large-scale and high-spatial resolution remote sensing image over Guangzhou obtained by GF2 satellite, PMS1 sensor on January 23, 2015, the experimental results demonstrate that the former has the advantage in classification speed while the latter has a higher classification accuracy.","tags":["deep learning","computer vision","scene classification","hyperspectral remote sensing image","large-scale and high-spatial resolution image"],"title":"Remote Sensing Image Classification Based On Deep Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Glaze spraying is a key process in ceramic production, yet how to make the glaze coating uniform in various situations is a rather confusing issue.

Today\u0026rsquo;s weather forecasts have focused on covering a large number of provinces, cities and other areas, ignoring some of the local small areas.

The world is rapidly urbanizing. Consequently, urban planning has become increasingly important and necessary to ensure that people have access to equitable and sustainable homes, resources and jobs.\nSmart growth focuses on building cities that embraces the E’s of sustainability—Economically prosperous, socially Equitable, and Environmentally Sustainable. To measure how successful the city meets the goal of smart growth, we propose a metric model to identify the degree of smart growth, and evaluate two cities’ metric. Then we offer unique smart growth plans for each city, considering the geography, expected growth rates, and economic opportunities.\nFirstly, we construct our metric, Smart Growth Metric (SGM) based on three aspect, Economically Prosperous, Socially Equitable and Environmentally Sustainable. The detailed factors are Per Capita Gross Domestic Product, Mean travel time to work, Per Capita Land, Primary Enrollment Rate (for Prosperous Metric) and Male/Female Income Ratio (for Socially Equitable Metric) and Urban Green Space Ratio (for Environmentally Sustainable).The weights of factors are determined by Grey Relational Analysis. In our case study, we choose Reykjavik and Ann Arbor to measure the degree of success of Smart Growth. Meanwhile, we select three Smart Growth Cities estimated by EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) and regard them as the evaluation criterions. We find that the current growth plans of Reykjavik and Ann Arbor both meet the smart growth principles. To estimate the expected growth rates, we predict Per Capita GDP in 2050 by means of Grey Forecast Model. Using sensitivity analysis, we evaluate the dynamic of the model and influence of expected growth rates, geography and economic opportunities. In order to measure geography factor and economic opportunity factor, we introduced two parameters α and β to re-evaluate the weights of the model, and take change of α and β as influence of two factors.\nTherefore, we set redesigned smart growth plans. Although the prosperity of Ann Arbor is based on Technology-oriented economy, the city still needs to improve community cohesion and search for renewable energy. On the contrary, Reykjavik should pay more attention to upgrade its industrial structure and develop a denser urban area. The geothermal energy guarantees an ecofriendly development of the city. In addition, we rank the potential of individual plans by Analytic Hierarchy Process. For Ann Arbor, social factors have the greatest potential, followed by environmental factors, and finally economic factors. While for Reykjavik, the most potential plan is industry upgrading, and the last one is environment plan. Society factor have middle potential. Finally, we adjust our plan under the situation that the population increase by an additional 50% by 2050.We find that Ann Arbor is likely to have society and environment problems. However, it will benefit Reykjavik’s economy.\n","date":1487001600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1487001600,"objectID":"6dd34c29bbf7dc0b43cf8bbe8902ca99","permalink":"https://OwenMasculinity.github.io/en/project/smart-city/","publishdate":"2017-02-14T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/project/smart-city/","section":"project","summary":"An problem of Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling of USA (ICM)","tags":["machine learning","smart growth","mathematical model competition"],"title":"Smart Growth of Cities","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n\rSlides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

But most of the public access to environmental information channels a single, not timely, can not accurately predict the future trend of environmental changes in the period; more importantly, the public exposure to meteorological, environmental and other information for the local authorities based on the region The data of several observatories are released uniformly. Such information is not very accurate for most small areas, and sometimes the deviations are even large.\nIn order to allow more users to enjoy timely and accurate regional meteorological and environmental information services and forecasts, the team developed a set of Internet as a carrier to the sensor network as a means of Internet technology and environmental information integrated monitoring together of the environmental monitoring information intelligent cloud service platform, tentatively named \u0026ldquo;iEnvironment \u0026rdquo; .\n\u0026ldquo;iEnvironment\u0026rdquo; platform is committed to creating customized small regional environmental information services. This project is combined with the National 863 Program and 973 Program Sub-project undertaken by WSN Lab of Wuhan University. The project is based on the environment of small-area wireless sensor network time encryption acquisition for small-area inaccurate meteorological and environmental services at this stage And meteorological monitoring data to provide customized meteorological and environmental information services, including but not limited to solar radiation real-time information and forecast information, real-time environmental monitoring information and forecast information, rainfall warning information push. And through the self-developed APP and website, access sensor network monitoring data and use the self-established algorithm model to process the data, realize the accurate service of meteorological environment information of small area, and improve the accuracy of regional meteorological and environmental data monitoring and forecasting , To improve the prediction of temporal resolution and spatial resolution, so as to add new vitality to the industry.\n","date":1466265600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1466265600,"objectID":"6693552485a3ab2c03242bbe7c759411","permalink":"https://OwenMasculinity.github.io/en/project/ienvironment/","publishdate":"2016-06-19T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/en/project/ienvironment/","section":"project","summary":"An environmental monitoring information intelligent cloud service platform.","tags":["environment","weather","platform","short-time","small-area"],"title":"iEnvironment","type":"project"},{"authors":["George"],"categories":["Introduction"],"content":" Academic makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free using Markdown.
